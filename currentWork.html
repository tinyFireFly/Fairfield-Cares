                <p>
                    Fairfield CARES relies on the Town of Fairfield, the Fairfield School District, and non-profit organizations to serve as its fiscal agent for 
                    the grant work that it undertakes. The majority of the coalition’s work is grant funded from the CT Department of Mental Health and Addiction 
                    Services (DMHAS). Often federal funding is distributed to states that in turn is distributed to community coalitions or to Local Prevention Councils (LPCs).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The coalition’s current substance misuse prevention goals and/or objectives include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Reduce the percentage of middle school and high school youth who drink alcohol in the past month to no more than 20%.</li>
                        <li>88% percent of middle and high school youth perceive underage drinking as harmful.</li>
                        <li>Increase the percentage of youth who perceive vaping as harmful.</li>
                        <li>Increase parent knowledge of the dangers of vaping.</li>
                        <li>Begin work to advocate for banning the sale of flavored tobacco products locally in Fairfield.</li>
                        <li>Increase the availability of opioid use disorder prevention materials throughout the community.</li>
                    </ol>
