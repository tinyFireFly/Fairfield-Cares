                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>In 2009, the then Fairfield CARES Task Force was established at the request of the First Selectman to address the problem of 
                    alcohol [abuse] misuse particularly by youth and young adults. The First Selectman empowered the task force with the responsibility 
                    to research, educate and advocate “for ways in which we as a community might foster an effective, responsible and compassionate 
                    approach to the abuse of alcohol and other substances”.</p>
                <p>From its inception, Fairfield CARES was a collective of individuals representing different sectors of the community coming together 
                    with the common purpose of preventing and reducing drug use (see below).  Today, the Fairfield CARES Community Coalition continues 
                    its initial charge. The Coalition's purpose is to prevent substance misuse and to promote healthy choices and positive youth and family development.</p>
                <p>CARES stands for Community, Awareness, Responsibility, Education, and Services.  The Coalition embodies all of these.</p>
                <p>On a monthly basis, parents, youth, representatives of schools, law enforcement, businesses, civic organizations, counseling & treatment services, 
                    among others convene to plan and implement evidence based strategies to prevent and reduce substance misuse in the Fairfield community. 
                    The Coalition applies the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) 
                    <a href="https://www.fairfieldct.org/filestorage/10736/12858/17079/19537/86474/OP12_-_samhsa-strategic-prevention-framework-guide.pdf">
                    Seven Strategies for Effective Community Change</a> to prevent and reduce substance misuse as shown in the attachment, 
                    <a href="https://www.fairfieldct.org/filestorage/10736/12858/17079/19537/86474/OP14_-_How_We_Do_Effective_Prevention.pdf">“How We Do Prevention”</a>. 
                    Those strategies are applied to three general spheres: Family, School, and Community. When initiatives for a given objective are implemented 
                    simultaneously in at least two or in all three of the spheres, the impact is stronger and behavior change is more likely to occur than if 
                    initiatives are implemented in only one area.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, it takes all of us working together to ensure that our youth thrive - making healthy choices and feeling good about 
                    themselves and their future.</p>
