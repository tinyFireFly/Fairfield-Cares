        <h2>Prevention Information</h2>
        <h3>Six Quick Tips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Don’t think “it’s not MY child” because every child is at risk.</li>
            <li>Remember that YOU are the biggest influence in your children’s life; the more you connect with your 
                children the less likely they’ll be to give in to peer pressure.</li>
            <li>Don’t be fooled that youth alcohol use is a rite of passage. It can damage an adolescent’s developing brain.</li>
            <li>Establish specific rules and consequences. Tell your children they are not allowed to drink, that 
                underage drinking will not be tolerated and enforce it.</li>
            <li>Be involved and monitor your child’s activities. Don’t allow youth drinking at home. Teens who are 
                allowed to drink alcohol in their home consume twice as much as those with a no-tolerance policy.</li>
            <li>Be a positive role model. Drink responsibly and let your teen see you decline alcohol from time to time as well.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Talk, They Hear You</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/talk-they-hear-you">Talk. They Hear You</a>
                is a campaign from SAMHSA that aims to reduce underage drinking and substance use among youths under 
                the age of 21 by providing parents and caregivers with information and resources they need to address alcohol and other 
                drug use with their children early. Download the 
                <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/talk-they-hear-you/mobile-application">"Talk. They Hear You"</a>App to practice talking to your kids about the 
                dangers of alcohol.</p>

        <h2>Research on Young Adults</h2>
        <p> Research Regarding Youth Adults indicates:
            <dl>
                <dt>Alcohol causes teen to make bad decisions.</dt>
                    <dd>The prefrontal cortex, involved in planning and decision-making, does not completely mature until after the teen years. 
                    Alcohol can harm a teen’s ability to reason and weigh options.</dd>
                <dt>Alcohol causes teens to take greater risks.</dt>
                    <dd>Connections between the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, a part of the brain’s reward system, are important in 
                        regulating impulsive behavior and are still maturing during adolescence. Alcohol can affect those connections, making 
                        teens more likely to do impulsive things they may regret.</dd>
                <dt>Alcohol causes teens to forget and lose memory.</dt>
                    <dd>The hippocampus, or the area in the brain that stores memory, is still maturing during adolescence. Research shows that 
                        even small amounts of alcohol can make teens less likely to recall something they learned earlier or remember what they 
                        did while drinking.</dd>
